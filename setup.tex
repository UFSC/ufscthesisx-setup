% The class `abntex2` loads the `enumitem` package with options.
%
% With the package option shortlabels you can use an enumerate-like syntax, where A, a, I, i and 1
% stand for \Alph*, \alph*, \Roman*, \roman* and \arabic*. This is intended mainly as a sort of
% compatibility mode with the enumerate package, and therefore the following special rule applies:
% if the very first option (at any level) is not recognized as a valid key, then it will be
% considered a label with the enumerate-like syntax.
%
% No spacing between enumerated items with \usepackage{enumerate}
